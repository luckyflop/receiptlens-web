Terms of Use - Receipt Lens AI
Effective Date: February 2026

Welcome to Receipt Lens AI. By installing or using our Chrome Extension, you agree to comply with and be bound by the following terms and conditions.

1. Description of Service
Receipt Lens AI is a tool designed to help users scan receipts, extract financial data using AI, and convert currencies. The service includes data processing via Google Cloud Functions and storage of usage metrics.

2. User Accounts and Authentication
Our extension uses Google OAuth 2.0 for user authentication.
We only access your email address and basic profile information to manage your subscription and usage limits.
I want you to know that you are responsible for maintaining the security of your Google account.
3. Subscription and License Keys
Users are granted 5 free scans upon registration.
A Pro License Key is required for unlimited scans (30-day period).
License keys are for personal use and should not be shared or redistributed.
4. Usage Limitations (Anti-Abuse)
Users must not attempt to bypass scan limits or "throttle" the service with automated scripts.
We reserve the right to block access (Status 403) to any user found abusing the API or violating the fair usage policy.
5. Data Privacy
We do not permanently store images of your receipts on our servers. Images are processed in real-time and discarded after data extraction.
Extracted data (Store name, Amount, Date) is handled locally on your browser for Excel export.
6. Disclaimer of Warranties
The service is provided "as is." While we strive for 100% accuracy in AI extraction, we do not guarantee that the results will be error-free (e.g., Server Error 500 or AI misinterpretations).

7. Limitation of Liability
Receipt Lens AI shall not be liable for any financial decisions made based on the data extracted by the extension. Users should verify all financial data manually before official use.

8. Changes to Terms
We reserve the right to update these terms at any time. Continued use of the extension after changes constitutes acceptance of the new terms.
